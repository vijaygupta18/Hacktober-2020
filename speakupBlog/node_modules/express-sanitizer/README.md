# express-sanitizer

An express middleware for [Caja-HTML-Sanitizer](https://github.com/theSmaw/Caja-HTML-Sanitizer), which wraps [Google Caja sanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/google-caja/wiki/JsHtmlSanitizer).

A useful complement to the [express-validator](https://github.com/ctavan/express-validator) -- to fill a gap now that XSS sanitization support has been removed from that module's parent [node-validator](https://github.com/chriso/node-validator).

## Installation

```
yarn add express-sanitizer
```

or

```
npm install --save express-sanitizer
```

## Usage

Import the module

```javascript
const expressSanitizer = require('express-sanitizer');
```

Mount the middleware *below* the `express.json()` (or, prior to express v4.16, `bodyParser()`) instantiation and *above* mounting of your routes

```javascript
app.use(express.json());

// Mount express-sanitizer middleware here
app.use(expressSanitizer());

app.post('/', function(req, res, next) {
  // replace an HTTP posted body property with the sanitized string
  const sanitizedString = req.sanitize(req.body.propertyToSanitize);
  // send the response -- res.body.sanitized = " world"
  res.send({ sanitized: sanitizedString });
});
```

## Output

The string
```javascript
'<script>hello</script> world'
```
will be sanitized to ' world'.

## Limitations

This is a basic implementation of [Caja-HTML-Sanitizer](https://github.com/theSmaw/Caja-HTML-Sanitizer) with the specific purpose of mitigating against persistent XSS risks (note the borderline abandonware comments in that repo).

## Caveats

This module trusts the dependencies to provide basic persistent XSS risk mitigation. A user of this package should review all packages and make their own decision on security and fitness for purpose.
