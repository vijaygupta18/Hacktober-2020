# TuringMachine

This is a program developed in IntelliJ idea, which purpose is to simulate the functionality of a Turing Machine.

This specific machine changes every pair of "00" to "11" and vice versa, this using a given graph (Found in src/images)

I hope this is useful for you!

If you are gonna run this in the same IDE, and you get an error, you may do this: 
* Go to "Run" 
* Go to "Edit configurations" 
* In "VM options" add the following line: 
	* --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml --module-path "YOUR_PATH_TO_JAVAFX_LIB_FOLDER"

Thanks for testing this out!
